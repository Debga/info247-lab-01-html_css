#INFO 247 Lab 01: HTML/CSS

##Instructions

###Setup
1. Clone this repository to your computer.
2. Open "index.html" & "main.css" in your text editor. 

###Goals
You are building a blog post page from an existing codebase that's half-finished. Take a look at result.pdf to see what the final result should be. Aim to mimic this as much as possible.

###Practice with HTML
1. Create a "container" div where all your content will reside in.
2. Create a menu using an unordered list.
3. The main content area contains your works. Start with placeholder content for one portfolio item: an image, a title, and some descriptive text. 

###Practice with CSS
1. Open the html file in a browser. It contains the content of a typical blog page, but it doesn't look like much because there are no styles.
2. First, start by resetting the CSS (google this code).
3. Follow the specific instructions outlined in the CSS file.
4. Change the portfolio item's title so it looks different than the body text.
5. Add more styles as you see fit. Recall the "cascading" nature of CSS and make sure you're re-using as many styles as possible instead of specifying new ones for every single element.
